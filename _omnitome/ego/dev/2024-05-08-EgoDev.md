I worked on::
- special text animations

- brief pauses for dialogue

- skipkey feature

I also ported the framework to a more capable system.

Next update tomorrow, and so on.

It was difficult to get this working at first because of the framework i was in.


- Pixi.js implementation (took half the day to figure out because the latest version had a bug, so I switched to a one i previously used)

- setup for buttons for in-game mechanics
- GUI Animaton

working on the implementation of UI, libraries, multiplane animation.

Goals:: May
recreate the Oz and PSST scene from the one trailer I made, utilizing multiplane animation.
create elements for narrative elements and game-mechanics for the story; create a more cohesive UI
make one cohesive scene that is playable with most of the mechanics I imagined for this interactive fiction story
