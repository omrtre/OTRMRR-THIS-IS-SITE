        Year 2180, March 3rd marks the release of Web 5.3.0, A.K.A, Internet 2.0. Welcome to the Virtual Revolution, the advent of Reality and Virtual Reality bridging technology. The Human body is now capable of accessing a virtually-physical dimension to interact with others within the same dimension.
        
        A psychology firm and interactive game software company collaborate to create an application that combines digital messaging and virtual-reality.
        
        A brotherhood of young men, the VELVETEERS, meet each other “physically” virtually in-person. The long hours spent in the dimension, causes the young men  to descend into lunacy—launching a massive infighting war.
        
        The Velveteers discover, “roasting”, mentally touches their opponent, cutting their connection to virtual-reality temporarily. The GAME OF ROAST goes viral, the application hits a breaking point causing a worldwide blackout. The application is deemed illegal and defunct.
        
        After years of inactivity, the application is rereleased anonymously. Now, virtual avatars can cross into the real world. BAD ACTORS appear to strike against society. The world is in need of virtual vigilantes. The Velveteers take responsibility, to reclaim their titles, and save the world wide web from $h!++!ng itself.

    - synopsis: |
        On the hills of Manachuria, the snow-covered mountains and ice-glazed lakes becomes fair ground to reckless wartime play-fighting.
        
        A 21-year war has dragged on. No man knows who or what they are fighting for, but the common consensus has come down to three goals:
        - Avoid DEATH, and live to fight for the next day.
        - Uphold a KILLSTREAK to maintain a RESPAWN cycle.
        - Be lucky to operate a TOY or gain the power of FLIGHT.
        
        The largest TOY known in the war has made its debut. It successfully realizes a possible conclusion to the war and the imminent destruction of several Academies. The TOY is destroyed by a single soldier. The aftermath of this event shocks the Academies, throwing each one on a mad-dash to conclude the war on their own terms, by all means necessary.
        
        In the clouds, below the bounds of the Ether, a churning plot boils. While the Academies fight to obtain a grip over the tide of the war, a storm approaches on the horizon, spelling exact doom for all Academies.

    - synopsis: |
        By now, the Earth’s Sea levels have risen to limits unimaginable. A metropolis who refused to evacuate, barricaded against the violent weather conditions, collapses under pressure—the Metropolis is now half submerged underwater. 

        Atlanteans arose from the calamity and made the Metropolis anew—a society for the wild, a home to a lifestyle unrestrained. 

        New Oceane is the epicenter of music and art. From around a stagnant world, people of all ethnicities, typically of young adult age, seek stardom here.

        A young man from an exotic land arrives in New Oceane to sponsor a novel invention: The Miracle 808 Soul Machine. A mystical machine which grants an individual the ability to “visualize the rhythm of their heart” and convert the vibrations into visual sound waves within reality, enhancing the experience of music.

        Unfortunately, after his success: getting signed with a record label and collaborating with newfound friends, he is let go, poisoned, and has his invention stolen and mass produced. 

        Here lies a cautionary tale of a young man who once had it all, deciding that the rest of his life should be dedicated for revenge.
